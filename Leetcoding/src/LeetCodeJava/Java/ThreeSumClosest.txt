Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 500
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-104 <= target <= 104

>> Thoughts
    sort the array
    Have two pointers on the left and 
    Have a variable that keep track of the gap between the target and the current sum
    Find the smallest gap

>> Pseudocode
    sort the array 
    define gap, min(smallest gap) variables
    iterate through the array and figure out the gap
    return min(smallest gap)
