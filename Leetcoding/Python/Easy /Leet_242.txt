Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Thoughts
    - Count occurence of each character in both strings
    - Use hashmaps; key is character, value is Count
    - Go through the keys to ensure the counts are the same
    - O(N)

    Optimized solution
    - sort the strings and compare
