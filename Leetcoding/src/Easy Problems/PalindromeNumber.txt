9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

>> Solution:
    palindrome - read the same way forward  and backward
    ex. x and reverse of x are equal
    we shouldn't convert int to string
    create a variable to keep reverse of x
    process digits of x from right to left , use %10 to retrieve the rightmost digit
    multiply reverse by 10 then increment by the rightmost digit
    remove the rightmost digit of x using division operator
    after the above, compare x to it's reverse

>> Pseudocode
    validate input:
        if x is -ve, return false
    create two variables - copy of x, reverse of x
    while copy > 0:
        retrieve the rightmost digit 
            digit  = copy % 10
        multiply reverse by 10 the increment by digit
        remove the rightmost digit by division with 10
            copy = copy / 10

        return true if reverse is equal to x

    Time complexity - O(log N) cause' we process each digit of x
    Space complexity - O(1)
