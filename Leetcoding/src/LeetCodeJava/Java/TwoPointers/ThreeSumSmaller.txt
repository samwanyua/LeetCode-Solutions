259. 3Sum Smaller

Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target,
find the number of index triplets i, j,k with 0< i < j < k < n that
satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target

Solve it in O(N^2)

Example: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
        output = 2
There are two triplets which sum are less than 2
 [-2,0,1]
 [-2,0,3]

 Example 2:
    input: nums = [], target = 0
    output: 0

>> Thoughts
    use two pointers O(N^2)
    Pointer to the outer for loop
    each iteration has left and right pointer

>> PseudoCode
    sort the array
    iterate every single element 
    define counter
    find out three sum
