Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.


>> Thought
    longest common prefix length equals the length of the first word
    compare the 1st word with every other word - compare to index upto length
    ex. "flower","flow","flight"
    length = 6, we will compare indices from '0 to 5'
    'flower' with 'flow', update length  from 6 to 4( indices 0 to 3)
    compare 'flower' with 'flight' - update length to 2
    generate substring from indices 0 -2
