Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numRows <= 30

Thoughts:

Certainly! Here's a detailed thought process for the given code:

Class and Method Declaration
Method generate: This method takes an integer numRows as input and returns a List<List<Integer>>, representing the first numRows of Pascal's Triangle.
Initialize Triangle
Create Triangle List: An empty List<List<Integer>> named triangle is created to store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.

Edge Case Check: If numRows is 0, the method immediately returns the empty triangle list since no rows need to be generated.

First Row Initialization
Create First Row: A List<Integer> named firstRow is created.
Add 1 to First Row: The number 1 is added to firstRow, representing the first row of Pascal's Triangle.
Add First Row to Triangle: firstRow is added to the triangle list.
Generate Remaining Rows
Loop Through Rows:

The outer loop runs from 1 to numRows - 1 (inclusive), with the loop variable i representing the current row index.
Get Previous Row: For each iteration of the loop, the previous row (i-1) is retrieved from the triangle list and stored in previousRow.

Create Current Row: A new List<Integer> named row is created to represent the current row.

Add Leading 1: A 1 is added to the beginning of row, as each row in Pascal's Triangle starts with 1.

Calculate Middle Elements:

The inner loop runs from 1 to i-1 (inclusive), with the loop variable j representing the current element index in the current row.
For each iteration, the element at index j in the current row is calculated as the sum of the elements at indices j-1 and j in the previousRow.
This calculated value is added to row.
Add Trailing 1: After the inner loop, a 1 is added to the end of row, as each row in Pascal's Triangle ends with 1.

Add Current Row to Triangle: The completed row is added to the triangle list.

Return Triangle
After all rows have been generated, the triangle list, which now contains the first numRows of Pascal's Triangle, is returned.
