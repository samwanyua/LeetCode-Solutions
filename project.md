## 1. Predicting Malaria Outbreaks (SDG 3 — Good Health and Well-Being)
### Problem Statement
Malaria remains a leading cause of death in parts of Africa. Early prediction of potential outbreaks can help in resource allocation, preventive measures, and saving lives.

### Tech Stack
* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Google Earth Engine / Remote Sensing Data (Rainfall, Temperature)
* XGBoost / LightGBM (Modeling)
* Tableau or PowerBI (Visualization)

### Datasets
* WHO Malaria Data — Cases by region/year
* Climate Data (NASA POWER) — Rainfall, temperature, humidity
* World Bank Health Indicators

### Brief Solution
* Collect climate (rainfall, humidity, temperature) and previous malaria incidence data.
* Build a classification model to predict "Risk Level" (Low, Medium, High).
* Provide monthly forecasts for high-risk areas.
* Build an interactive dashboard for health officials to monitor outbreaks.

## 2. Food Security — Crop Yield Prediction (SDG 2 — Zero Hunger)
### Problem Statement
Small-scale farmers often lack predictive insights into crop yields, leading to inefficiencies and food insecurity.

### Tech Stack
* Python (TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning)
* Satellite Imagery (NDVI indices from Sentinel-2)
* AWS S3 / GCP Storage (Data management)
* Streamlit (to deploy prediction app)
### Datasets
* FAO Crop Yield Data — Crop production stats (global)
* Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery (Copernicus Open Access Hub) — NDVI (greenness) index
* USDA Cropland Data Layer — High-quality labeled crop data (good for training)

### Brief Solution
* Use satellite imagery and past crop yield data to predict the future yield.
* Build a model that predicts output per hectare.
* Deploy a simple web app where farmers can input their farm coordinates and get yield predictions and farming advice.

##  3. Electricity Access Prediction in Rural Africa (SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy)
### Problem Statement
Millions of rural households lack access to electricity. Governments need smart tools to prioritize where to extend the grid.

### Tech Stack
* Python (Geospatial libraries: GeoPandas, Rasterio)
* Machine Learning (Random Forest)
* Satellite Nightlight Data (VIIRS/DMSP)
* PostgreSQL/PostGIS (Spatial Database)

### Datasets
* VIIRS Nighttime Light Dataset — Brightness at night per location (proxy for electricity access)
* WorldPop Population Data — High-res population maps
* Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) — Household surveys about electricity access (Africa/Asia)

### Brief Solution
* Collect nightlight intensity data as a proxy for electricity access.
* Train a model to predict "probability of access" across rural areas.
* Visualize areas with < 20% probability to prioritize for future projects.

##  4. Water Quality Monitoring (SDG 6 — Clean Water and Sanitation)
### Problem Statement
Unsafe drinking water is a major cause of diseases. Monitoring water quality manually is expensive and slow.

### Tech Stack
* IoT Sensors Data (pH, Turbidity, Nitrate levels)
* Python (Anomaly Detection models)
* Flask API (to collect sensor data)
* Grafana (Real-time dashboard)

### Datasets
* WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) — Water access and quality data worldwide
* US EPA Water Quality Data — Nitrate, pH, turbidity data (good for training)
* Kaggle Water Quality India Dataset — Predict if water is safe or not

### Brief Solution
* Simulate or connect to IoT water quality sensors.
* Build anomaly detection models to flag unsafe readings in real-time.
* Create a dashboard that alerts officials when water quality drops below safe thresholds.

## 5. YouTube Video Comment Sentiment Analyzer
### Problem Statement
Content creators need fast ways to understand how audiences feel about their videos.

### Tech Stack
* Python (TextBlob/VADER for sentiment analysis)
* YouTube API (to scrape comments)
* Plotly Dash (dashboard for visualization)

### Brief Solution
* Pull comments for a specific video/channel.
* Analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
* Visualize results over time (e.g., sentiment trend during a video's lifetime).


## 6. Smart Rescheduler for Missed Appointments
### Problem Statement
Many service businesses (hospitals, salons, consultants) lose money when people miss appointments.
Can we build a system that predicts no-shows and suggests the best reschedule times automatically?

### Tech Stack
* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM)
* Time series feature extraction (date/time, holidays, weather)
* Flask or FastAPI for app demo

### Brief Solution
* Train a model to predict likelihood of no-show for upcoming appointments.
* When high-risk is detected, auto-suggest 3 better time slots (based on past show-up rates).
* Deploy as a small scheduling assistant API.

 ## 7. Art Theft Detection from Online Galleries
### Problem Statement
Art theft is rising online — people steal digital art without credit.
Can you help artists by detecting if their art was stolen or reposted elsewhere?

### Tech Stack
* Python (TensorFlow/Keras)
* Image Similarity Models (Siamese Networks or CLIP from OpenAI)
* Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)

### Brief Solution
* Use scraped images from online platforms.
* Train a model to find visual near-duplicates even after minor changes (cropping, filters).
* Alert the original artist if likely stolen copies are found.

## 8. Drug Side Effects Prediction (Healthcare AI)
### Problem Statement
New drug combinations sometimes lead to unexpected side effects. Predicting risks can save lives.

### Tech Stack
* Python (PyCaret, XGBoost)
* SMILES Molecular Data (Chemical structure encoding)
* RDKit (for molecular feature extraction)

### Unique Angle
* Input: chemical structure of a new drug or combo.
* Output: probability of specific side effects.
* Healthcare companies love these types of projects — real-world impact.
